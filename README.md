An interactive story written for web.

As I began my journey into web development, this project became a place where I could practice using Javascript to manipulate elements on a webpage.
<a href="https://github.com/theTyster/duck_story/releases/tag/1.0.0">Version 1</a> of the story was about 600 lines of static JavaScript. Characters were made with ascii art in \<pre\> tags.
It walked the user through one branch of the story and had almost no animations and very little illustrations.
It really was just about learning the code.

Now, it is transforming into a full-blown react app. Complete with full-color character's and animations using the <a href="https://greensock.com">GreenSock Animation Program</a>.

# Goals for the Duck.
I still intend to use this project primarily as a way for me to learn more about programming. 
But alongside that I also want it to:

	1. Provide young children with a gentle environment where they can learn how to use a mouse and keyboard in a fun and entertaining place on the web.
		- Create beautiful animations with GSAP.
		- Use the React API and App design. 
		- Integrate 3rd party tools to allow safe and fun plugins that can interact with the story.

# Read The Story!
Visit <a href="https://theDuckSays.click">theDuckSays.click</a> to view the current version of the story. 
The complete story might not yet be readable as it is still being actively developed. But, if you want to see where I am at, this is where you can see my progress in real-time.

I usually deploy the story to this link when I feel significant changes have been made to it and their are minimal bugs.

Whenever I reach a point where the story has a clear beginning middle, and end, has undergone some level of testing and works without any known bugs, I create a release. 
The releases are not complete versions of the story. But, serve more as mile-markers in my learning path and the development process.

If you just want to know how the story ends you can read the original "manuscript" for this project in <a href="https://github.com/theTyster/duck_story/blob/main/docs/story.md">the docs directory</a>.


# Viewing Older Versions
With every commit in this repo, I learn more. I tag commits which contain complete functionality of the story (on some level) as a <a href="https://github.com/theTyster/duck_story/blob/main/docs/story.md">release</a>.

To view these versions, you will need to download the release, unzip it, and then open the file called `index.html` or `page1.html` if you are viewing <a href="https://github.com/theTyster/duck_story/releases/tag/1.0.0">Version 1</a>.
