One day duck was splashing in the pond with his best friend:

-Frog
-dog
-hog
-eggnog

Ducks best friend was a [frog, dog, hog, carton of eggnog] named {friend}.


"You sure are one goofy friend, {friend}." Duck said as they splashed together.
{friend} laughed.
Duck laughed.

After a little while it started to rain.

How bad was the rain storm?

not too bad ------0------ Really bad

"we should get out of the water during a rainstorm.", said {friend}.

"Yeah. I'm getting hungry anyways. What should we eat today?"

What should she eat?

-Pizza
-bag of pudding
-Grapes

"Let's eat {food}", said {friend}.

# Pizza Story
So, duck and {friend} decided to head into town to visit a pizza shop they had seen a few times.

It was called Pizza Fantastic. And it was truly the most fantastic pizza place they had ever seen.

As soon as they walked in the door, a lady screamed

"AAAAHHHHH OH EM GEEEE IT'S A DUCK AND A {friend}!!!!!! SHOO SHOO!!!"

The owner, Mr. Fantastic, came over.
"Sorry, guys." He said. "I can only serve paying customers today."

Duck and {friend} had to leave.

"That wasn't very fantastic", said {friend}.
Duck nodded.

"But, I bet we could still get some pizza if we are sneaky."

"How is that?" asked {friend}.

"We'll start a band! And then when we play music people will pay us money and we can use that to get pizza!", said duck.

"That sounds awesome!", said {friend}. 

So, they got some music stuff together and practiced real hard.

Finally, they felt like they were ready.

They went back to Pizza Fantastic and started playing one of the songs they rehearsed outside the pizza shop.

Which song should they play:

-{song1}
-{song2}
-{song3}

**They play the song**

How good was that song?

real good -------0-------- Not very good


That was a {rating} song! Duck and {friend} made {prorated money amount}!
They still need {money left to get a pizza}.

What should they play next?

-{song1}
-{song2}
-{song3}

-- repeat as necessary --


FINALLY!! They had enough money to buy a pizza!

"Now we just have to find a way to sneak inside without getting caught by that scary screaming lady." {friend} said.

"Let's go around the back.", said duck.


So, they went around the back and when Mr. Fantastic came outside to take out the trash they snuck inside and grabbed a pizza and left the cash on the counter.


YAYY!

Duck and Frog were so happy they did a little dance in it.

The end.


## Grape story

"Good idea {friend}", said duck. "As a matter of fact a friend of mine said theres a guy who gives grapes to ducks (and other animals) not too far from here!"

So they went to the park where they found a few food carts and snack vendors.

"He's the one who runs the lemonade stand.", said duck confidently.

they walk up to the lemonade stand.

"Hey." says duck.

"got any grapes?"

The man puts down the newspaper he is reading and he looks furious.

He immediately grabs a bottle of glue and starts to chase them screaming "NOT AGAIN! I WILL STOP YOU THIS TIME! LEAVE MY LEMONADE STAND ALONE!!!"

Man runs at them and says "I'M GONNA GLUE YOU TO A TREE!!'"
duck and {friend} get really big eyes. and {friend} says "RUN FOR IT!"

[chasing game - outrun the crazy lemonade stand guy]

Game ends with them either getting caught and glued to a tree (retry) or running into another stand but this ones a grape stand.

And the guy gives them some grapes.

the end.


# bag of pudding

just then, {friend} remembered something.

"Why don't we eat some of that bag of pudding we have been saving?!" said {friend} excitedly.

"oh yeah that's a great idea!", said duck. I think I left it under that old bridge.

*under the old bridge*

duck lifts the bag of pudding into the air. A bird swoops down and swipes it.

then flies up into a tree.

"HEY!!" they both shout.

"GIVE THAT BACK!!" but the bird ignores them.

"I guess we have to climb that tree." says duck.

[tree climbing game]
*** use mouse to jump from branch to branch avoiding some of the other residents of the tree. like owls and squirrels. ***

Ends with them getting the bag of pudding and drinking out of it with straws.

the end.
